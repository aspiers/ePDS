# Deployment

## Production Deployment (Docker)

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- A domain with DNS control
- An SMTP provider (e.g. [Resend](https://resend.com/), SendGrid, AWS SES, Postmark)

### DNS Setup

Point the following records at your server:

| Record                 | Target                                 |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `pds.example.com`      | your server IP                         |
| `auth.pds.example.com` | your server IP                         |
| `*.pds.example.com`    | your server IP (for handle resolution) |

### Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values.
See [configuration.md](configuration.md) for a full reference.

### Build and Start

```bash
# Build images (always use --no-cache — cache busting is broken)
docker compose build --no-cache

# Start services
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f
```

Caddy handles TLS automatically via ACME/Let's Encrypt.

### Updating

```bash
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

Note: `docker compose restart` does **not** pick up `.env` changes.
Always use `docker compose up -d` to recreate containers after changing environment variables.

## Railway Deployment

Railway is the primary cloud deployment target. Each package has a
`railway.toml` that configures its build.

### Prerequisites

- A [Railway](https://railway.app/) account (Pro plan recommended for volume size)
- The [Railway CLI](https://docs.railway.com/guides/cli) installed and logged in
- DNS control for your domain

### Project Setup

1. Create a new Railway project and link it to your GitHub repo:

   ```bash
   railway init
   railway link
   ```

2. Create three services in the Railway dashboard (or via CLI), one per package:
   - `@certified-app/pds-core`
   - `@certified-app/auth-service`
   - `@certified-app/demo`

3. Link each package directory to its service:

   ```bash
   cd packages/pds-core && railway link
   cd packages/auth-service && railway link
   cd packages/demo && railway link
   ```

### Volumes

Both pds-core and auth-service need persistent volumes for their SQLite
databases. Create them from each package directory:

```bash
cd packages/pds-core
railway volume add --mount-path /data

cd packages/auth-service
railway volume add --mount-path /data
```

The demo app is stateless and does not need a volume.

**Important**: The mount path must match the env vars:

- pds-core: `PDS_DATA_DIRECTORY=/data` (also stores blobs at `/data/blobs`)
- auth-service: `DB_LOCATION=/data/epds.sqlite`

### Environment Variables

Run the setup script to generate `.env` files, then paste the values into
each service's raw environment editor in the Railway dashboard:

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh

# Strip comments and blank lines for pasting into Railway:
grep -v '^\s*#' packages/pds-core/.env | grep -v '^\s*$'
grep -v '^\s*#' packages/auth-service/.env | grep -v '^\s*$'
grep -v '^\s*#' packages/demo/.env | grep -v '^\s*$'
```

Alternatively, use the Railway CLI:

```bash
cd packages/pds-core && railway variables set KEY=VALUE ...
```

### DNS Setup

Point the following records at Railway's DNS target (shown in the dashboard
under each service's custom domain settings):

| Record                 | Service      |
| ---------------------- | ------------ |
| `pds.example.com`      | pds-core     |
| `auth.pds.example.com` | auth-service |
| `*.pds.example.com`    | pds-core     |
| `demo.example.com`     | demo         |

Railway handles TLS automatically.

### Deploying

Railway deploys automatically on push to the linked branch. Each service's
`railway.toml` defines `watchPatterns` so only relevant changes trigger a
rebuild.

To manually redeploy:

```bash
cd packages/pds-core && railway redeploy --yes
cd packages/auth-service && railway redeploy --yes
cd packages/demo && railway redeploy --yes
```

### Viewing Logs

```bash
cd packages/pds-core && railway logs --deployment
cd packages/auth-service && railway logs --deployment
cd packages/demo && railway logs --deployment
```

### Railway-Specific Notes

- Each service reads only its own per-package `.env` — the top-level `.env`
  is not used on Railway.
- The demo app runs Next.js with `output: "standalone"` in production. If you
  see a warning about this, ensure the start command uses
  `node .next/standalone/server.js` instead of `next start`.
- Volumes cannot be configured via `railway.toml` — they must be created
  through the dashboard or CLI.
- Services with volumes have brief downtime during redeployment (Railway
  cannot mount the same volume to two containers simultaneously).

## Service Ports

| Service      | Internal port | Public          |
| ------------ | ------------- | --------------- |
| PDS Core     | 3000          | via Caddy (443) |
| Auth Service | 3001          | via Caddy (443) |
| Caddy        | 80, 443       | yes             |

## Generating Secrets

```bash
# PLC rotation key (secp256k1)
openssl ecparam -name secp256k1 -genkey -noout | \
  openssl ec -text -noout 2>/dev/null | \
  grep priv -A 3 | tail -n +2 | tr -d '[:space:]:'

# Generic secrets (JWT, DPOP, HMAC keys, etc.)
openssl rand -hex 32
```

## Generating an Invite Code

If `PDS_INVITE_REQUIRED` is true (the default), generate a high-`useCount` invite code
and set it as `EPDS_INVITE_CODE`:

```bash
curl -X POST https://<pds-hostname>/xrpc/com.atproto.server.createInviteCode \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Basic $(echo -n 'admin:<PDS_ADMIN_PASSWORD>' | base64)" \
  -d '{"useCount": 1000}'
```
