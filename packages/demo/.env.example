# ============================================================================
# demo — Environment Variables
# ============================================================================
#
# The demo is a standalone Next.js app. It does NOT share any env vars with
# pds-core or auth-service. It only needs to know the public URLs of the PDS
# and auth service.
#
# How env vars are loaded depends on context:
#
#   Railway/Vercel:   Set these in the platform dashboard.
#   docker-compose:   Loaded from packages/demo/.env via env_file.
#   pnpm dev:demo:    Next.js loads packages/demo/.env automatically.

# Public URL of this demo app (used for OAuth client_id and redirect_uri).
# Must be http://127.0.0.1:<port> for local loopback, or an HTTPS URL for
# production (ATProto OAuth requires HTTPS for discoverable client IDs).
PUBLIC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3002

# PDS URL (the ePDS instance to authenticate against)
PDS_URL=https://pds.example

# Auth endpoint (the ePDS auth service's OAuth authorize URL)
AUTH_ENDPOINT=https://auth.pds.example/oauth/authorize

# For local dev without Caddy (direct to services):
# PDS_URL=http://localhost:3000
# AUTH_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3001/oauth/authorize

# PLC directory for DID-to-handle resolution
# PLC_DIRECTORY_URL=https://plc.directory

# Session signing secret (generate with: openssl rand -base64 32)
# SESSION_SECRET=change-me-in-production
